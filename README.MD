# Mapping Vacant Lots in Toledo, Paran√°, Brazil

First of all, the goal of this small project was to figure out how to extract GPS data from pictures and use it on a leaflet map. 

The easiest way to achive that seems te using the command line application from ExifTool, the function used can be found in the file get_exif.R and was made using this tutorial: https://paleolimbot.github.io/tutorial/rexiftool.html

Afterwards, I used the magick library to compress the photos, since the output is a html flexdashboard file I didn't want it use too much space.

one small discovery that I made while trying to build the popups when using crosstalk objects is that you need to extract the photos path as a vector from the crosstalk object to be able to plot it on a leaflet map, works flawlessly and does not mess up with the finicky nature of the crosstalk lib
