# Mapping Vacant Lots in Toledo, Paran√°, Brazil

First of all, the goal of this small project was to figure out how to extract GPS data from pictures and use it on a leaflet map. 

The easiest way to achieve that seems to be using the command line application from ExifTool. The function used can be found in the file get_exif.R and was made using this tutorial: https://paleolimbot.github.io/tutorial/rexiftool.html

Afterwards, I used the magick library to compress the photos, since the output is a html flexdashboard file I didn't want it occupy too much space.

One small discovery that I made, while trying to build the popups using crosstalk objects, is that you need to extract the photos paths as a vector from the crosstalk object to be able to plot it on a leaflet map, works flawlessly and does not mess up with the finicky nature of the crosstalk lib.

the final product can be found here: https://sterndavi.github.io/vacant.lots.toledo/
